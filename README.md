# Vendor Performance Analysis

An end-to-end data analysis solution to help organizations measure and optimize vendor performance. By integrating supply chain data with statistical modeling, we identified key drivers of profitability and inventory efficiency.

## 🛠️ Step 1: Data Creation & Ingestion

The project began by designing a relational database schema representing a retail supply chain.

- **Database Design:** Created 6 core tables (Inventory, Purchases, Sales, Invoices) using MySQL Workbench.
- **Automated Pipeline:** Developed a Python script (`ingestion_db.py`) to automate the migration of raw CSVs into a local SQLite database (`inventory.db`), including automated logging for performance monitoring.

## 📊 Step 2: Business Logic & Data Transformation

In the `EDAFiles/` phase, we moved beyond raw data to create high-level business entities.

- **SQL CTEs:** Used Common Table Expressions in Python to join disparate tables, calculating Lead Times, Freight Costs, and Sales-to-Purchase ratios at the vendor level.
- **Feature Engineering:** Calculated critical KPIs like Gross Profit, Profit Margin, and Stock Turnover to identify vendor health.

---

## 📈 Step 3: Statistical Analysis & Hypothesis Testing

The `VPA/` phase involved deep-dive research to find actionable patterns.

- **T-Tests & Confidence Intervals:** Compared profit margins between top and low-performing vendors. Top vendors operate at a statistically significant higher margin (~97%), which is not due to random chance.
- **Correlation Analysis:** Used heatmaps to identify the link (0.96) between sales volume and logistics overhead.
- **Outlier Detection:** Used boxplots to identify "Slow-Moving" products with a Stock Turnover < 1.

## 🌐 Step 4: Interactive Web Dashboard

The final output is a responsive Business Intelligence Dashboard that allows stakeholders to explore the findings.

- **Frontend Tech:** Built with HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript.
- **Secure Access:** Features a login gateway to protect sensitive vendor data.
- **Visual Insights:** A card-based layout where users can interact with modals to see detailed statistical plots and actionable business intelligence.
